# Flask-Boostrap-Starter-Kit
This is a flask bootstrap starter kit I use for spinning up static sites using bootstrap very quickly. 

Here's how to get started:

1. Clone the repo
1. Install the requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
1. Build your HTML pages using Bootstrap + Jinja and place in `/app/templates/`
1. Run your server `flask run`
1. Start making cool stuff!
